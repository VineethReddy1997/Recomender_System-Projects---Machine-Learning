# Movie-Recommender-in-python# Recommender Systems with Python

Welcome to the code notebook for Recommender Systems with Python. we will develop basic recommendation systems using Python and pandas.

we will focus on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case, movies. Keep in mind, this is not a true robust recommendation system, to describe it more accurately,it just tells you what movies/items are most similar to your movie choice.
